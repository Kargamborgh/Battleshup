**Subject:** A classic game of Battleship programmed with Java. The aim of the game is to put several ships of differing sizes onto a 10x10
grid and then take turns in shooting one square at a time. After the shot the game will announce whether the shot hit or missed. The game
ends when one player has lost all of their ships. 

**Users**: Player 1, player 2. If there is time left, a simple AI will be implemented, otherwise two human players

**Functions for all users:** Starting the game, placing ships, shooting

25.9.2014 changes:

Grid will be a single instance of 20x10 squares instead of two 10x10 grids and both players' ships will be placed on the same grid.
